# Why there are different files with Dongle Ethernet
Because mannagg a  Tp_link the ethernet adapter that I paid 10 euros is very nice and works very well.. but.. it's too bad for this laboratory because it destroys all my calculations because it is a device with Store&Forward, and adds other times that I cannot calculate with precision.

I therefore decided to use both formulas (Rtt with or without a Store&Forward device) here too to see which graphs come out. I have not tested yet but I think the behavior is very similar to that of the Switch, let's see together!
